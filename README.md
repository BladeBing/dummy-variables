-1, 0, 1 encoding system for linear regression

#There is a key difference between the binary 1, 0 encodings that you've been working with, 
#and the -1, 0, 1 encoding system: In the 1, 0 coding system, comparisons are to the baseline category 
#as we've discussed, whereas in the 1, 0, -1 coding system comparisons are to the overall average.
